# Yeoman generator for SystemJS / ES6 / jspm / Angular / React

This project is the generator for the [SystemJS Seed project](https://github.com/lookfirst/systemjs-seed/) and [SystemJS Material Start ES6 project](https://github.com/lookfirst/systemjs-material-start). Please see those projects for more details and examples.

# Note!

This project is a bit out of date now due to jspm being a bit of a moving target. I've been slammed with starting a new business and haven't had a chance to keep things up to date. PR's welcome!

# Usage

```
npm install -g gulp jspm yo generator-systemjs
```

```
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
yo systemjs
gulp run
http://localhost:9000
```
